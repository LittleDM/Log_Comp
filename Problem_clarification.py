# 1. Clarify the problem statement.

# I attempt to put the dilemma in the form of a deductive argument (if I have understood things correctly so far!).

# IF you see something in your path AND you decide to change lanes AND as you change lanes, something else is in that lane THEN you have an ethical dilemma.

# Premise A: You see something in your path
# True: If you see something in your path
# False: If you do not see anything in your path

# Premise B: You decide to change lanes.
# True: If you decide to change lanes
# False: If you decide not to change lanes

# Premise C: Something else is in that lane
# True: There is something else is in that lane
# False: There is nothing else in that lane
# If all three (A, B, C) premises are TRUE then the conclusion (Z) is TRUE.

# Conclusion Z: You have an ethical dilemma.
# True: If you have an ethical dilemma
# False: If you do not have an ethical dilemma 

# If A and B and C then Z.
